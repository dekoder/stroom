* Issue **#4849** : Fix the default forwarding queue config so that it retries for HTTP and not for FILE. Add the config prop `queue.queueAndRetryEnabled` to control whether forwarding is queued with retry handling or not. Add the config prop `atomicMoveEnabled` to `forwardFileDestinations` items to allow disabling of atomic file moves when using a remote file system that doesn't support atomic moves.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
