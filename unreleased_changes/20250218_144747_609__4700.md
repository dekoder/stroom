* Issue **#4700** : Add props `forwardFileDestinations.subPathTemplate`,  `forwardFileDestinations.templatingMode` and `forwardHttpDestinations.errorSubPathTemplate` to allow templating of the file destination paths. Change the default retries to infinite. Make the following Stroom status codes go straight to the HTTP forwarder error destination: FEED_IS_NOT_DEFINED(101), FEED_IS_NOT_SET_TO_RECEIVE_DATA(110), UNEXPECTED_DATA_TYPE(120). Make the `data` directory more permissive to invalid files/directories that it finds. Remove the retry config prop `maxRetries` and replace it with `maxRetryAge` and `retryDelayGrowthFactor` to allow for a retry delay that grows with each retry. Change the file forwarder to support queueing/retry for remote file systems. Move the queue/retry config into the `queue` branch of the destination config.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
