* Change the proxy config properties `forwardUrl`, `livenessCheckUrl`, `apiKeyVerificationUrl` and `feedStatusUrl` to be empty by default and to allow them to be populated with either just a path or a full URL. `downstreamHost` config will be used to provide the host details if these properties are empty or only contain a path. Added the property `livenessCheckEnabled` to `forwardHttpDestinations` to control whether the forward destination liveness is checked (defaults to true).


```sh
# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
