* Issue **#4312** : Add Data Feed Keys to proxy and stroom to allow their use in data receipt authentication. Replace `proxyConfig.receive.(certificateAuthenticationEnabled|tokenAuthenticationEnabled)` with `proxyConfig.receive.enabledAuthenticationTypes` that takes values: `DATA_FEED_KEY|TOKEN|CERTIFICATE` (where `TOKEN` means an oauth token or an API key).

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
