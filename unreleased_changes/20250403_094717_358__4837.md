* Issue **#4837** : Change the fetching of OIDC config to use jersey client instead of Apache http client. The yaml properties `appConfig.security.authentication.openId.httpClient` and `proxyConfig.security.authentication.openId.httpClient` have been removed. Configuration of the jersey client is now done using `jerseyClients.OPEN_ID.` (see https://gchq.github.io/stroom-docs/docs/install-guide/configuration/stroom-and-proxy/common-configuration/#jersey-http-client-configuration).


```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: OIDC config GET uses httpClient, but token calls use jerseyClient

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
