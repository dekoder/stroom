* Issue **#5030** : Add new property `.receive.x509CertificateDnFormat` to stroom and proxy to allow extraction of CNs from DNs in legacy `OPEN_SSL` format. The new property defaults to `LDAP`, which means no change to behaviour if left as is.


```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: Support legacy DN format when extracting identity from certificates
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5030
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
