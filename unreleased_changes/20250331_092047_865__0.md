* Feed status check calls made by a proxy into stroom now require the application permission `Check Receipt Status`. This is to stop anyone with an API key from discovering the feeds available in stroom. Any existing API keys used for feed status checks on proxy will need to have `Check Receipt Status` granted to the owner of the key.


```sh
# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
