* Issue **#4450** : Fix editor completion in Query editor so that it doesn't limit completions to 100. Added the property `stroom.ui.maxEditorCompletionEntries` to control the maximum number of completions items that are shown. In the event that the property is exceeded, Stroom will pre-filter the completions based on the user's input.


```sh

# Issue title: Code Completion in StroomQL is not quite right

# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
