* Issue **#4109** : Add `receive` config properties `x509CertificateHeader`, `x509CertificateDnHeader` and `allowedCertificateProviders` to control the use of certificates and DNs placed in the request headers by load balancers or reverse proxies that are doing the TLS termination. Header keys were previously hard coded. `allowedCertificateProviders` is an allow list of FQDN/IPs that are allowed to use the cert/DN headers.

# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: Provide a mechanism for trusted proxies to perform authentication and pass subject via HTTP headers
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4109
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
